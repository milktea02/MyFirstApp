Modified the Simple Calculator into a YuGiOh Life Points Calculator

TODO:
- [ ] Write tests!!! (what if I'm not even adding/substracting right oops)
- [ ] Show which player is highlighted/selected
- [ ] Game State Checking (did a player die?)
- [ ] Allow users to enter own name
- [ ] Sound effects (maybe)
- [ ] Fancy countdown effect
